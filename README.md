# tic-tac-toe
This is the second project in my 7-day project hackathon. It's a 1v1 tic tac toe game, with focus on user interface.

## User stories:

### MVP:

- [x] 1. **Display Initial Game Board:** As a player, I want to see an empty 3x3 grid representing the game board when I open the game.

- [x] 2. **Take Turns:** As a player, I want to take turns with another player (or against an AI) to place my symbol (X or O) on an empty cell of the game board.

- [ ] 3. **Winning Condition:** As a player, I want the game to declare a winner when any player forms a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- [ ] 4. **Draw Condition:** As a player, I want the game to declare a draw when all cells on the board are filled and no player has won.

- [ ] 5. **Display Player's Turn:** As a player, I want to see a visual indication of whose turn it is (displaying "Player X's Turn" or "Player O's Turn").

- [ ] 6. **Undo Move:**
As a player, I want to be able to undo my last move during the game.

- [ ] 7. **Reset the Game:** As a player, I want to be able to reset the game to its initial state to play another round.

### Stetch:

- [ ] 1. **Player Names:** As a player, I want to enter my name or choose a character name that will be displayed on the game screen.

- [ ] 2. **Score Tracking:** As a player, I want to see a score counter that keeps track of the number of wins for each player.

- [ ] 3. **Multiple Game Modes:**
As a player, I want to choose between playing against another player or playing against an AI opponent with varying levels of difficulty.
